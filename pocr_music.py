# Randomizes the music that plays globally

HELP = """ randomizes the music that plays globally (so I think only two different songs will play, one for battles and one for gummi/town/boss)
Options - some arguments can be passed in through command line using format 'ARGNAME=VALUE'
        Alternatively set an os environment variable USE_KH2_{ARGNAME}=VALUE
help - display this string
seed - sets a specific seed for the random number generator
outpath - sets a different path for the output pnach file, default is same directory as script
setvalue - instead of randomizing the value use a set value (Value needs to be in HEX)
